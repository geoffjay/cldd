Control Logging and Data Acquisition Daemon

Meant to function as a highly configurable system for interacting with physical
sensors and actuators. The CLD library (currently at gitorious.org/cld/libcld)
is responsible for a lot of the actual hardware interfacing, data logging, and
feedback control using a simple PID algorithm.
