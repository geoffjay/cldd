Control Logging and Data Acquisition Daemon

Needs to be implemented:

- load config from system or user rc file depending on daemon or not
- implement daemon code, still not sure whether or not to do a typical daemon or
  use glib-esque main loop with async method, the latter is probably easier
- define message handling for ZeroMQ and Protocol Buffer implementation, this
  will probably happen inside of libcld
